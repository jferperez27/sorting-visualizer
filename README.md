# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project was originally made to practice my personal design and implementation of several popular sorting algorithms for my own personal understanding. Although implementing such sorting algorithms facilitated my understanding for such sorting techniques, I found it hard for me to understand why some algorithms were more preferable than others. Thus, the inspiration behind this project.

## ðŸš€ Why this project?
I'm a Junior at Brown University studying computer science and political science. 

In high school, I came across a video on YouTube showcasing a program that visualized sorting algorithms. Although I wasnâ€™t aware of how this would apply to me in the future, at the time I found it quite satisfying how a program was able to sort such bars from smallest to largest in a couple seconds. This weirdly satisfying video would become the inspiration towards completing this project. I linked the video below since I will admit that it served as the driving force towards what I wanted this sorting visualizer to do at a high-level. 

## ðŸ¤“ About the Project/Implementation

I implemented the program using high-level object-oriented programming, using techniques to make the program safe (proper encapsulation, polymorphic design, etc). The main window and key event handling is handled inside of the PaneOrganizer class, delegating such tasks to be handled inside of their prospective classes.
