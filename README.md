# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This program utilizes some popular popular sorting algorithms by calling on such algorithms to a randomized array of integers. This array of integers is visualized as a bar, its height being dictated by the integer in the array in its corresponding index. The user can call on the sorting algorithm of choice and begin the sorting process on the array. Every change on the array of integers is shown visually by updating the bars on the screen to visualize the algorithm in real-time (default speed is exceptionally slower than an actual sorting algorithm to make it visually easier to digest).

## ðŸš€ Why this project?

Sorting algorithms are essential for any programmer to understand and recreate. Although at first the main reason behind this project was to refresh my current knowledge with JavaFX and practice my implementation of sorting algorithms, I quickly learned that this project really helped with my understanding of how such algorithms functioned. I've always been a visual learner, so I hope that others find this visualizer just as helpful in understanding such a fundamental concept in computer science.

## ðŸ¤“ About the Project/Implementation

I implemented the program using high-level object-oriented programming, using techniques to make the program safe (proper encapsulation, polymorphic design, etc). The main window and key event handling is handled inside of the PaneOrganizer class, delegating such tasks to be handled inside of their prospective classes.
